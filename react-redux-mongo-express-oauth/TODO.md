# TODO

I want to sort this out a little more...

## Immediate

- OAuth
  - front end
    - make all oauth actions occur via store actions
    - check for a login cookie instead of always having to login on reload
    - make logout work
  - back end
    - do more?

## Goals

### Near-term

- higher order components to add:
  - forms
  - listing (actually use what is already there?)
- redux improvements:
  - show more complex patterns in redux for dealing with data manipulation

### Planned

- language tools
  - immutable.js?
  - typescript?
- front end tools
  - redux first router?
  - CMS setup
  - material ui?
- databases
  - postgres as an option
  - neo4j as an option
- APIs
  - graphql via apollo (server and/or client)?
- Ops
  - containerized ops setup
- documentation
  - add notes for proper deployment and CI
- performance
  - improve lighthouse scores
