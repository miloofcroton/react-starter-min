What sets me apart is a clear-headed approach to being the best at what I do and skillful communication, particularly after a cup of coffee. I've had a unique path to this profession, and while it hasn't given me every advantage, I can leverage areas in which it has. You may think I'm punching above my weight class, but I'm here to prove something to you, that hungry dogs run faster and that you can't afford to not give me a chance.

Not to be confused with loud-mouthed know-nothings, I would happily walk quietly and learn from those who carry a big stick, but closed mouths don't get fed. And occasionally, I know a thing or two.

I do what I do because I love it. There are easier lives and better ways of satisfying the elusive sort of balanced life that everyone aspires to, but I am like a German Shepherd puppy left alone with a brand new sofa if I don't have challenging problems to solve.
