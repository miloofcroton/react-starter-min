# Group agreement

## Communication Plan

We have already established that we are aligned as far as schedule (early morning start works for us). 
We will sit with each other in our group area so we can reach out when we need help. We will check in with each other several times a day and use stand up time to go over what we have done, what we need to cover and any challenges we encounter. 

We will ensure that we donâ€™t move forward without checking in with the others.
Lastly, communicate before and after coding sessions, to eliminate conflicts about what we are doing.

## Conflict Plan

When we run into conflicts, we have agreed to revisit project goals and seek majority in the group. If we do not have a majority, we can continue to seek arbitration. We always have to assume positive intent.

## Work Plan

Scaffold the project and then determine tasks. 
We will utilize pair programming to maximize efficiency and stay flexible to what seems to work best as we go.
Continuously review with team members and check in throughout the day.
Utilizing sticky notes or Trello to organize and track our progress.
Coming up with a schedule to align on work/break times.

## Git Process

We will talk to each other before picking a new task, after completition of previous task. This will be done to prevent merge conflicts. Jack will be the Git Master, and we will take time whenever we make a git action to make sure everything is kosher. Also, we will always work in our own branches to avoid affecting Master.


## Anything Else You Feel Is Important

We'll meet around 9 and leave around 5 or 6. We'll have a standup in the morning at the start and in the afternoon after lunch.
