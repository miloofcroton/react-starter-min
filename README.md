These are mostly (well, all at the moment) web applications, but I plan to have a few mobile examples as well as a few other things, hopefully including various distributed infrastructures and deployment strategies. This is for myself to see how parts can be added, removed, and replaced, sort of like a massive kata. Plus, it's obviously a good thing to have done, as it becomes jumping off points for yourself in the future.
